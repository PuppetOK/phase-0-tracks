# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control is a feature that lets you work on existing projects without losing any data. You can revert to an older version of your code if you make a mistake. It is useful for that exact reason, if you make a mistake it doesn't ruin anything. You can also have multiple versions of the same code on different local machines so different people can be working on the code at the same time.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?
