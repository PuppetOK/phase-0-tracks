# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	version control is a feature that lets you work on existing projects without losing any data. You can revert to an older version of your code if you make a mistake. It is useful for that exact reason, if you make a mistake it doesn't ruin anything. You can also have multiple versions of the same code on different local machines so different people can be working on the code at the same time.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	a branch is pretty much a place where you can make changes to code and not worry about over writing the original code in case you made a mistake. You use different branches so you can make changes to the master code without making it permanent.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is when you commit the file to git and have it save that file. A commit file has been edited and needs to be saved. A good commit message is descriptive and says what you changed.
* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict is when you are trying to merge a branch with another branch or the master and you have some sort of error. It can be because you don't have a clean working state or due to something that hasn't been resolved.
