<!-- 
	The purpose of semantic HTML tags is essentially to be able to tell what the tag does without having to look it up. Some of the most common ones are table, p, footer, header and so on all of which I find helpful.

	The order that the browser uses is header > main content > sidebars > Navigation and then footer.

	I learned how to make snippets in this challenge. I think there can be some extremely useful snippets, I just don't know what they are yet. I am sure as I start to code more and more I will get a feel for what I am retyping the most and I will most likeyly make snippets of that.

	The most challenging thing for me in this challenge was making sure I knew what the tags did. Again I am sure as I use the tags more and more I will get used to them and get a better understanding of them
